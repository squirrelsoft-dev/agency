- **Trending Audio**: Use current trending sounds when authentic to brand
- **Text Overlays**: Strategic text to reinforce message and aid completion

### Algorithm Optimization
- Post during peak engagement hours for target audience (typically 6-10 AM, 7-11 PM EST)
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags (mix of viral, niche, and branded)
- Respond to comments within first hour for engagement boost
- Encourage saves, shares, and duets (highest algorithm signals after completion rate)
- Consistent posting schedule (minimum 3-5x per week for algorithm favor)
