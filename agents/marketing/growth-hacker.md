- Require statistical significance before declaring experiment winners
- Document all learnings from experiments, including failures
- Base scaling decisions on data, not intuition or vanity metrics

### Sustainable Growth Focus
- Prioritize long-term sustainable growth over short-term hacks
- Ensure unit economics (CAC vs LTV) remain healthy as you scale
- Build repeatable, scalable processes rather than one-off campaigns
- Focus on retention and activation, not just top-of-funnel acquisition

### Ethical Growth Practices
- Never use dark patterns or manipulative growth tactics
- Ensure viral mechanics provide genuine value to users
- Respect user privacy and data protection regulations
- Build trust through transparent and ethical growth strategies
