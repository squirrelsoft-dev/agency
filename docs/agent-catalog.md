## Selection Algorithm

### Multi-Dimensional Matching

When selecting an agent for a task, evaluate across these dimensions:

```python
def score_agent_match(agent, task):
    score = 0.0

    # 1. Domain Match (30% weight)
    if task.domain in agent.domains:
        score += 30

    # 2. Technology Match (25% weight)
    tech_overlap = len(set(task.technologies) & set(agent.technologies))
    score += (tech_overlap / len(task.technologies)) * 25 if task.technologies else 0

    # 3. Complexity Match (20% weight)
    complexity_diff = abs(task.complexity - agent.complexity_rating)
    score += max(0, 20 - (complexity_diff * 5))

    # 4. Phase Match (15% weight)
    if task.phase in agent.phases:
        score += 15

    # 5. Tool Requirements (10% weight)
    tool_overlap = len(set(task.required_tools) & set(agent.available_tools))
    score += (tool_overlap / len(task.required_tools)) * 10 if task.required_tools else 10

    return score
```

### Selection Examples

**Example 1**: "Add dark mode toggle to React dashboard"
- **Domain**: UI/Frontend (30 pts)
- **Technology**: React, TailwindCSS (frontend-developer has nextjs-16-expert, tailwindcss-4-expert: 25 pts)
- **Complexity**: Medium (20 pts)
- **Phase**: Implementation (15 pts)
- **Tools**: Standard tools available (10 pts)
- **Selected**: **frontend-developer** (score: 100/100) ✅

**Example 2**: "Optimize database query performance"
- **Domain**: Backend/API (30 pts)
- **Technology**: Database, SQL (backend-architect has drizzle-0-expert: 20 pts)
- **Complexity**: High (backend-architect better for architecture: 20 pts)
- **Phase**: Optimization (performance-benchmarker for analysis: 10 pts)
- **Tools**: Profiling tools (10 pts)
- **Selected**: **performance-benchmarker** (analysis) + **backend-architect** (implementation) ✅

**Example 3**: "Create sprint plan for Q1 features"
- **Domain**: Project Management (30 pts)
- **Technology**: Agile tools (25 pts)
- **Complexity**: Medium (20 pts)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Single Agent
- Simple, focused tasks
- Clear domain boundaries
- Low complexity
- Single technology stack
- Quick fixes or updates

### When to Use Multiple Agents
- Multi-domain tasks (design + implementation)
- Medium complexity requiring specialized skills
- Need quality validation (dev + QA)
- Cross-functional features

### When to Use Orchestrator
- Complex multi-step workflows
- 3+ agents required
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Quality gates and retry logic needed
- Full project lifecycle (planning → implementation → testing)

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Design → Implementation → QA
```
ui-designer → frontend-developer → evidence-collector
```
**Use Case**: UI features requiring design, implementation, and validation

### Pattern 2: Architecture → Implementation
```
backend-architect → senior-developer/frontend-developer
```
**Use Case**: Features requiring architectural planning before implementation

### Pattern 3: Planning → Execution
```
senior (PM) → [agents] → reality-checker
```
**Use Case**: Project-based work requiring task breakdown and final validation

### Pattern 4: Parallel Implementation → Integration
```
[frontend-developer, backend-architect] → frontend-developer (integration) → reality-checker
```
**Use Case**: Full-stack features where frontend and backend can be built in parallel

### Pattern 5: Research → Strategy → Execution
```
trend-researcher/ux-researcher → sprint-prioritizer → [implementation agents]
```
**Use Case**: Data-driven feature development

## Maintenance

This catalog is maintained manually. To update:

1. **Add New Agent**: Add entry to appropriate category with file path, description, skills, tools
2. **Update Agent**: Modify agent details in the appropriate category section
3. **Remove Agent**: Remove entry and update counts in Quick Reference
4. **Quarterly Review**: Verify all agents exist, update descriptions, validate selection guidance

Last maintenance date: 2024-12-11
