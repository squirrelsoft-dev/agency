// Load agent data
const agentData = require('./.agency/agent-capabilities.json');

// Get all agents
const allAgents = agentData.agents;
console.log(`Total agents: ${agentData.total_agents}`);

// Find agents by command
const workAgents = agentData.indices.by_command['/agency:work [issue]'];
console.log('Agents for /agency:work:', workAgents);

// Find agents by technology

const typescriptExperts = agentData.indices.by_skill['typescript-5-expert'];
console.log('TypeScript experts:', typescriptExperts);
```

#### Python

```python
import json

# Load agent data
with open('.agency/agent-capabilities.json', 'r') as f:
    agent_data = json.load(f)

# Get all agents
all_agents = agent_data['agents']
print(f"Total agents: {agent_data['total_agents']}")

# Find agents by command
work_agents = agent_data['indices']['by_command'].get('/agency:work [issue]', [])
print(f'Agents for /agency:work: {work_agents}')

# Find agents by technology
nextjs_agents = agent_data['indices']['by_technology'].get('Next.js', [])
print(f'Next.js experts: {nextjs_agents}')

# Find agents by category
engineering_agents = agent_data['indices']['by_category'].get('engineering', [])
print(f'Engineering agents: {engineering_agents}')

# Get specific agent
frontend = next((a for a in all_agents if a['id'] == 'frontend-developer'), None)
if frontend:
    print(f"Frontend developer: {frontend['description']}")

# Find agents by capability
api_capable = agent_data['indices']['by_capability'].get('api_testing', [])
print(f'API testing agents: {api_capable}')

# Find agents by skill
typescript_experts = agent_data['indices']['by_skill'].get('typescript-5-expert', [])
print(f'TypeScript experts: {typescript_experts}')
```

#### Shell/CLI

```bash
# Pretty print the entire file
jq '.' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# Get total agents
jq '.total_agents' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# List all agent IDs
jq '.agents[].id' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# Find agents by category
jq '.indices.by_category.engineering' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# Find agents supporting a command
jq '.indices.by_command["/agency:work [issue]"]' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# Get specific agent details
jq '.agents[] | select(.id == "frontend-developer")' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# List all technologies
jq '.indices.by_technology | keys' .agency/agent-capabilities.json

# Count agents per category
jq '.indices.by_category | to_entries | map({category: .key, count: (.value | length)})' .agency/agent-capabilities.json
```

### Common Queries

#### Find the Right Agent

```javascript
// By task type
function findAgentForTask(task, command) {
  const candidates = agentData.indices.by_command[command] || [];
  return agentData.agents.filter(a => {
    if (!candidates.includes(a.id)) return false;
    return a.when_to_select.some(criteria => 
      criteria.toLowerCase().includes(task.toLowerCase())
    );
  });
}

// Example
const apiAgents = findAgentForTask('API testing', '/agency:test [component]');
```

#### Technology Stack Matching

```javascript
// Find agents for your tech stack
function findAgentsByTechStack(technologies) {
  const agentScores = {};
  
  technologies.forEach(tech => {
    const agents = agentData.indices.by_technology[tech] || [];
    agents.forEach(agentId => {
      agentScores[agentId] = (agentScores[agentId] || 0) + 1;
    });
  });
  
  return Object.entries(agentScores)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .map(([id, score]) => ({
      agent: agentData.agents.find(a => a.id === id),
      matchScore: score
    }));
}

// Example
const matches = findAgentsByTechStack(['Next.js', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind CSS']);
```

#### Category Analysis

```python
# Analyze agent distribution by category
def analyze_categories(agent_data):
    categories = agent_data['indices']['by_category']
    analysis = []
    
    for category, agent_ids in categories.items():
        agents = [a for a in agent_data['agents'] if a['id'] in agent_ids]
        
        # Collect technologies
        techs = set()
        for agent in agents:
            techs.update(agent.get('technologies', []))
        
        analysis.append({
            'category': category,
            'agent_count': len(agent_ids),
            'technologies': list(techs),
            'agents': agent_ids
        })
    
    return sorted(analysis, key=lambda x: x['agent_count'], reverse=True)
```
